AutoCRUD 1.2 (formerly AutoController)
======================================

This plugin is designed to significantly reduce the amount of controller code you need to write by automating the most common controller actions, specifically the creating, read, updating and deleting of models that been been associated with a controller.

AutoCRUD follows the Wheels approach of Convention over Configuration and is designed to be used silently with minimal overhead and configuration.

For usage, please see the included documentation (click on the plugin name once it has been installed). For installation instructions, please see the official CFWheels documentation.
