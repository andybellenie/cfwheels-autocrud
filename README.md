AutoCRUD 1.2
============

This plugin is designed to significantly reduce the amount of controller code you need to write by automating the most common controller actions, specifically the creating, read, updating and deleting of models that been been associated with a controller.

AutoCRUD follows the Wheels approach of Convention over Configuration and is designed to be used silently with minimal overhead and configuration. In a typical web-app, use of AutoCRUD can reduce your controller code by around 80%.

AutoCRUD was formerly called AutoController but the name was updated to more accurately describe its functionality.
